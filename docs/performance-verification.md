# Gameplay performance evidence

## 2026-09-26 baseline

Stock PAL A1200, 68020, 2 MiB chip RAM, no Fast RAM; muted debug
output with game audio processing enabled. `SLICKS_BENCHMARK=1`,
`amiga/diag_benchmark.gdb`, source baseline `749bb11` (the later documentation
commit does not change the executable). No debugger stops during measurement.
Local log: `tmp/perf-baseline-749bb11.log`.

603 measured updates, all above the 312-raster-line/20-ms budget.
Maximum work: 1429 lines (91.6 ms), at frame 574. Maximum wall time:
1568 lines. Mean update cadence: 674241 / 602 = 1120 lines (71.8 ms).
These are emulated target measurements, not host execution timings.

Final measured frame, raster lines:

| Component | Lines |
| --- | ---: |
| Simulation and chunky rendering | 1070 |
| Audio | 11 |
| C2P | 70 |
| Diagnostics | 6 |
| Actor restore (within simulation/rendering) | 268 |
| Particle advance | 49 |
| Update | 128 |
| HUD | 39 |
| Actor draw | 582 |

The phase breakdown is the final frame, **not** the maximum-work frame.
Work excludes synchronization waits; actual update cadence must also meet
the target. This legacy benchmark is a reproducible optimization baseline,
not proof of general gameplay across tracks, vehicles and particle loads.
The fixture rejects race errors, missing measurements and audio VBI spills.
